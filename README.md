[postech icon here] [hak-sik icon here]
~~..So tired.. Please give me pull request for icons~~

Personal project for Hak-sik crawler and automatic sender.

Nobody can use this rather than POSTECHIAN. (maybe... KAISTian can use... But why?)

## Features
- automatic crawling hak-sik
- automatic discord message sending, containing information of today's haksik
- (Optional feature) automatic crawling and sending KAIST dining

## Requirements

This project requires `Python 3.*`, *requests*, *beautifulsoup4* for running.

## How to set

1. wget or Download & unzip on your server.
    - you can use `git clone https://github.com/carotinoid/Postech_dining_discordBot.git`


2. Create the file named `webhook`, and paste the webhook token(URL) of your own discord server. Then this program send message to your own discord server.
(Optional) Create the file named `webhook2`, and paste the webhook token(URL) of the channel for KAIST dining.

3. Use schedule program such as `crontab` on server for sending automatically.
    - Running `request.py` gathers information from Postech Dining site and save to the cache file.
    - Running `send.py` updates the cache and sends the message to the discord server. Cache file has to exist initially.
